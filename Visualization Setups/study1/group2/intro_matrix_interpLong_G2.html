        <h3>Introduction</h3>

            
       <p>
        This is a research study. We want to understand how to best show network data (items with connections between them). 
        We will use a matrix to show you how cooking ingredients (ex: salt, meat) are used in receipes together. 
        All ingredients are listed once vertically and once horizontally. Two ingredients are connected (used in many receipes
        together) if there is a black dot in the matrix at their intersection. The example below shows that beans are often used
        with bacon, while cheddar is used on broccoli. 
       </p>

        You can interact with the visualization. <b>Zoom</b> by using the mouse wheel. <b>Pan</b> by pressing the left mouse button down and
        dragging (as in Google maps). 
        <b>Select and deselect</b> ingredients as <b>answers</b> by double-clicking on them (either in the row or column headers).
        <b>Select and deselect</b> ingredients as <b>highlights</b> by clicking once on them (either in the row or column headers). 
              <b>Mouse-over</b> ingredients and links (the black dots) to highlight them.

        Here is an example of a selected answer, a highlighted row, a hovered row and a hovered connection respectively.<br><br>

	<p>We will ask you a few questions about this data. Please answer the questions as fast and accurate as possible by viewing
         and interacting with the visualization. There will be a <b>countdown</b> for each question; once it expires, we will 
         hide the visualization. We will give you a <b>turk-code</b> to use for payment once you finish the study.</p>

        <b>The study includes two questions we consider to be easy enough that everyone can answer correctly. You need to answer both
        correctly to receive payment.</b>

          <b>Task1</b>: <b>"Given two highlighted ingredients, select all ingredients that they both connect to."</b><br><br>


         Remember, you
         can select and deselect nodes by clicking and double-clicking on them. Selecting a node will turn it blue. See a few examples below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
             <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em></td></tr>
           <tr>
			<td><img src="images/matrix-commonNeighbor_example1_qn.png" height="300"></td>
			<td><img src="images/matrix-commonNeighbor_example1_ans.png" height="300"></td>
		   </tr>
           <tr>
			<td><img src="images/matrix-commonNeighbor_example2_qn.png" height="300"></td>
			<td><img src="images/matrix-commonNeighbor_example2_ans.png" height="300"></td>
		   </tr>
         </table> 

<br><Br><br><br>
        
             <b>Task2</b>: 
             
         <b>"Given two pairs of ingredients (red and blue), estimate which pair is linked by fewer other ingredients."</b><br><br>
        
         See the first example below for how you can link two ingredients with other ingredients.

         <br><br>

	HINT: This is an estimation task! You may not have time to find the exact match, just give your best guess (see example 2).
       
	<br><br>
         <table align="center">
             <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em>
			 </td></tr>
             <tr>
				<td><img src="images/radu_mat_path1.png" ></td>
				<td><img src="images/answerOption_red.png" /><br/> </td>
			 </tr>
           
           <tr>
			<td><img src="images/radu_mat_path2.png"></td>
			<td><img src="images/answerOption_red.png">
                <u><b>Note</b> </u> 
                Probably red, because the ingredients are in the same cluster 
                  or closer together while the blues aren't.
               </td>
