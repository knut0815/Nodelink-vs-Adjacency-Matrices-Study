        <h3>Introduction</h3>

            
       <p>
        This is a research study. We want to understand how to best show network data (items with connections between them). 
        We will use a matrix to show you how US airports (e.g. MIA, JFK) are often used for connecting flights. 
        
		
		
		
		
		All airports are listed once vertically and once horizontally. Two airports are connected (often used for 
		connecting flights) if there is a black dot in the matrix at their intersection. 
		The example below shows that FLL is connected to two airports (GSO and IND), JAX is connected to four airports
		(FWA, GNV, GRR, GSO, ITH), and both IAD and ISO are not connected to any airports.
       </p>

				You can interact with the visualization.

			<ul>
			
				<li>
					<b>Zoom</b> by using the mouse wheel.

				<li>
					<b>Pan</b> by pressing the left mouse button down and dragging (as in Google maps).
				</li>
				<li> 
					<b>Select and deselect</b> airports as <b>answers</b> by double-clicking on them (either in the row or column headers).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Select and deselect</b> airports as <b>highlights</b> by clicking once on them (either in the row or column headers). 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Mouse-over</b> airports and links (the black dots) to highlight them.
				</li>

	<p>We will ask you a few questions about this data. Please answer the questions as fast and accurate as possible by viewing
         and interacting with the visualization. There will be a <b>countdown</b> for each question; once it expires, we will 
         hide the visualization. We will give you a <b>turk-code</b> to use for payment once you finish the study.</p>

	<b>We will pay a $2 bonus to the user with the best overall accuracy/time.</b>

        <b>The study includes two questions we consider to be easy enough that everyone can answer correctly. You need to answer both
        correctly to receive payment.</b>

        <h3>Tasks</h3> 
         <b>Task 1</b>: <b>"Given the two highlighted airports, select all airports that they both connect to."</b> <br><br>
 	
	Hint: Two airports have a common connection if they both have a black dot on a given column. <br><br>

         Remember, you
         can select and deselect nodes as answers by double-clicking on them. A selected answer node has a black border around it. See a few examples below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
	   <tr><td align="center">Questions</td><td align="center">Answers</td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="g2-images/task1-mat-1-qn.png" height=250></td><td><img src="g2-images/task1-mat-1-ans.png" height=250></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="g2-images/task1-mat-2-qn.png" height=250></td><td><img src="g2-images/task1-mat-2-ans.png" height=250></td></tr>
         </table>

	<br><br>
  
        
        <b>Task2</b>: <b>"Given the two highlighted pairs of airports (red and blue), can you estimate which pair has a shorter path of connections between them?"</b><br>
         <br>See the examples below for how you can link two airports with other airports. 

         <br><br>
		 HINT: The group whose members are closer in number of steps from each other wins. 
		 
			This is an estimation task! You may not have time to find the exact match, just give your best guess.		<br><br>
