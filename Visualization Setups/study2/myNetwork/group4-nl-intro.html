        <h3>Introduction</h3>


        <p>
            This is a research study. We want to understand how to best show network data (items with connections between them). 
            We will show you a visualization of US airports (ex: MIA, JFK) with links between airports that 
			often have connecting flights.
        </p>

		<div>
		
			<div style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
				You can interact with the visualization as follows: 
			</div>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Zoom</b> by using the mouse wheel. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Pan</b> by pressing the left mouse button down and
					dragging (as in Google maps).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Select and deselect</b> airports as <b>answers</b> by double-clicking on them.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Select and deselect</b> airports as <b>highlights</b> by clicking on them once.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Move</b> airports by 
            dragging them (sometimes this can be useful to tell where its links go).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Mouse-over</b> airports and links to highlight them.
				</li>
				
			</ul>			
		
			<div style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
			   Here is an example of a selected answer, a highlighted node, a hovered node and a hovered edge respectively.<br>
				<img src="node-selected-answer.png" height="150"/>
				<img src="node-clicked.png" height="160"/>
				<img src="node-hover2.png" height="160"/>
				<img src="edge-hover2.png" height="160" />
			</div>	            
		</div>
		
		<br><br>
        <p>We will ask you a few questions about this data. Please answer the questions as fast and accurate as possible by viewing
            and interacting with the visualization. There will be a <b>countdown</b> for each question; once it expires, we will 
            hide the visualization. We will give you a <b>turk-code</b> to use for payment once you finish the study.</p>

        <p align="center">

            <br>
            <b>We will pay a $2 bonus to the user with the best overall accuracy/time.</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>The study includes two questions we consider to be easy enough that everyone can answer correctly. You need to answer both
                correctly to receive payment.</b>   
            <br>
            <br>

        <h3>Tasks</h3> 

		
        <b>Task1</b>: <b>"Determine if a highlighted airport is connected to another given airport "</b><br><br>
        
        See a few examples below:<br>
        <table align="center">
            <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em></td></tr>
            <tr><td>
                    <br> <em>Is the highlighted airport (MLI) connected to LBB? <br> <br>
                        <img src="g4-images/task1-1-qn.png"></td><td><img src="yes-answer.png" ></td></tr>
						
			<tr><td>
				<br> <em>Is the highlighted airport (ORD) connected to SIT? <br> <br>
				<img src="g4-images/task1-1-qn.png"></td><td><img src="no-answer.png" ></td></tr>

        </table> 

        <br><br>

        <b>Task2</b>: 

        <b>"Given two highlighted airports, determine the shortest number of links between them."</b><br>

       
        <br>See a few examples below:

        <br><br>
        <table align="center">
            <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em></td></tr>
            <tr><td  style="padding-right: 10px;">
			<img src="g4-images/task2-1-qn.png"  /></td><td><td style="padding-left:0px"><b>2</b> </td><br/>           
			<tr><td  style="padding-right: 10px;">
			<img src="g4-images/task2-1-qn.png"  /></td><td><td style="padding-left:0px"><b>2</b> </td><br/>           
        </table>
