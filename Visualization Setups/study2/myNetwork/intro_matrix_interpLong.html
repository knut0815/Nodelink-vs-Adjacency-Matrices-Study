        <h3>Introduction</h3>

            
       <p>
        This is a research study. We want to understand how to best show network data (items with connections between them). 
        We will use a matrix to show you how US airports (e.g. MIA, JFK) are often used for connecting flights. 
        
		
		
		
		
		All airports are listed once vertically and once horizontally. Two airports are connected (often used for 
		connecting flights) if there is a black dot in the matrix at their intersection. 
		The example below shows that FLL is connected to two airports (GSO and IND), JAX is connected to four airports
		(FWA, GNV, GRR, GSO, ITH), and both IAD and ISO are not connected to any airports.

	<p>We will ask you a few questions about this data. Please answer the questions as fast and accurate as possible by viewing
         and interacting with the visualization. There will be a <b>countdown</b> for each question; once it expires, we will 
         hide the visualization. We will give you a <b>turk-code</b> to use for payment once you finish the study.</p>

	<b>We will pay a $2 bonus to the user with the best overall accuracy/time.</b>

        <b>The study includes two questions we consider to be easy enough that everyone can answer correctly. You need to answer both
        correctly to receive payment.</b>

        <h3>Tasks</h3> 
         <b>Task 1</b>: <b>"Given two highlighted airports, select the one with more connections."</b> <br><Br>
 	
	Hint: an airport has as many connections as there are dots on its row or column. <br><br>

         Remember, you
         can select and deselect nodes as answers by double-clicking on them. A selected answer node has a black border around it. See a few examples below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
	   <tr><td align="center">Questions</td><td align="center">Answers</td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task1_qn.png" height=200></td><td><img src="matrix-task1_ans.png" height=200></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task1_2_qn.png" height=200></td><td><img src="matrix-task1_2_ans.png" height=200></td></tr>
         </table>

	<br><br>
  
        
        <b>Task2</b>: <b>"Select all airports that the highlighted airport is connected to."</b><br><br>

	Hint: find all dots on the selected row and trace them up to their column labels. <br><br>

        Remember, you
        can select and deselect nodes as answers by double-clicking on them. A selected answer node has a black border around it. See a few examples below:<br><br>
       
        <table align="center">
	   <tr><td align="center">Questions</td><td align="center">Answers</td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task2_qn.png" height=200></td><td><img src="matrix-task2_ans.png" height=200></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task2_2_qn.png" height=200></td><td><img src="matrix-task2_2_ans.png" height=200></td></tr>
         </table>

        
        <br> <br>

        <b>Task3</b>: <b>"Given two highlighted clusters of airports, select the cluster that 
            has the most interconnections between its members."</b><br><br>

	
        See a few examples below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
             <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-cluster_task1_1_qn.png" width="450"></td><td><img src="red-answer.png" width="160" ></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-cluster_task1_2_qn.png" height="400"></td><td><img src="blue-answer.png" width="160" ></td></tr>
