Task1: Given two highlighted nodes, select the one with the larger degree.

Task2: Given a highlighted node, select all its neighbors

Task3: Given two clusters of highlighted nodes, which one is more interconnected?

Task4: Given two highlighted nodes, select all of the common neighbors.

Task5: Given two pairs of highlighted nodes (red and blue) and limited time, estimate which pair is closer in terms of graph topology?"

Task6: How many clusters are there in the visualization?

Task7: Given two groups of highlighted nodes (e.g., red and blue) and limited time, estimate which group is larger.

Task8: Given two highlighted nodes decide whether they belong to the same cluster.  clusters shown via color

Task9: Given one highlighted node and one named node, are they connected?

Task10: Given two highlighted nodes, how long is the shortest path between them?

Task11: Memorability: After spending several minutes on task 10, can participants remember the answers they gave to task 9, without access to the visualization?

Task12: Given two highlighted nodes and three named ones, which of the named nodes is connected to both highlighted nodes?

Task13: Given a selected node, how many nodes are within two edges' reach?

Task14: Memorability: After spending several minutes on tasks 13, can participants remember (i.e., select) which nodes were highlighted as part of task 12, if showed the visualization with the answers they gave to task 13 highlighted?
